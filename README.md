<h1>Python fundamentals</h1>

<i>Problem set to learn the fundamentals of Python. </i>

<h3>1. Hello, world!</h3>

Write a program that prints “Hello, world!” to the screen.

<h3>2. Current time</h3>

Write a program that prints the current time and date to the console.

<h3>3. FizzBuzz</h3>

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except for the following conditions. 
For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

<h3>4. Factorial digit sum</h3>

Write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of the factorial of a number. n! means n x (n − 1) … x 3 x 2 x 1. For example, 10! = 10 x 9 x … x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

<h3>5. Guessing game</h3>


Write a guessing game where the user must guess a secret number. 
After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. 
At the end the number of tries needed should be printed.
It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

<h3>6. Largest and smallest in list</h3>

Write a function that returns the largest and smallest elements in a list.

<h3>7. Palindrome test</h3>

Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.

<h3>8. Merge list and sort</h3>

Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list. [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6].

<h3>9. Newton’s method for square roots</h3>


Implement the square root function using Newton’s method. In this case, Newton’s method is to approximate sqrt(x) by picking a starting point z and then repeating:

z_next = z - ((z*z - x) / (2 * z))
To begin with, just repeat that calculation 10 times and see how close you get to the answer for various values (1, 2, 3, …). Next, change the loop condition to stop once the value has stopped changing (or only changes by a very small delta). How close are you to the math.sqrt value?

<h3>10. Reverse string</h3>

Write a function to reverse a string.
